Prometheus Config for Alerta
============================

Consolidate alerts from [Prometheus](http://prometheus.io/) and other
tools (like Nagios or Zabbix) into a single "at-a-glance" console.

Installation
------------

Install the following:

  * Prometheus
  * Prometheus Alertmanager
  * Alerta

Configuration - Alertmanager
----------------------------

This integration takes advantage of configurable webhooks available with
Prometheus [Alertmanager](http://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/).

Support for Prometheus is built-in to Alerta so no special configuration
is required other than to ensure the webhook URL is correct in the
Alertmanager config file.

**Example `alertmanager.yml` receivers section**

```
receivers:
- name: "alerta"
  webhook_configs:
  - url: 'http://localhost:8080/webhooks/prometheus'
    send_resolved: true
```

**Note:** If the [Docker container for Alerta](https://hub.docker.com/r/alerta/alerta-web/)
is used then the webhook URL will use a host and port specific to
your environment and the URL path will be `/api/webhooks/prometheus`.

If Alerta is configured to enforce authentication then the receivers
section should define BasicAuth username and password or the webhook
URL should include an API key:

**Example `alertmanager.yml` receivers section with BasicAuth**

```
receivers:
- name: "alerta"
  webhook_configs:
  - url: 'http://alerta:8080/api/webhooks/prometheus'
    send_resolved: true
    http_config:
      basic_auth: 
        username: admin@alerta.io
        password: alerta
```

**Example `alertmanager.yml` receivers section with API Key**

```
receivers:
- name: "alerta"
  webhook_configs:
  - url: 'http://localhost:8080/webhooks/prometheus?api-key=QBPALlsFSkokm-XiOSupkbpK4SJdFBtStfrOjcdG'
    send_resolved: true
```

Configuration - Rules
---------------------

Alertmanager rules define thresholds at which alerts should be triggered.
The following table illustrates how Prometheus notification data is
used to populate Alerta attributes in those triggered alerts:

| **Prometheus**         | Type          | **Alerta**   |
-------------------------|---------------|---------------
| instance      (*)      | internal      | resource *   |
| alertname     (*)      | internal      | event        |
| environment            | label         | environment  |
| severity               | label         | severity (+) |
| correlate              | label         | correlate    |
| service                | label         | service      |
| job           (*)      | internal      | group        |
| value                  | annotation    | value        |
| description or summary | annotation    | text         |
| unassigned labels      | label         | tags         |
| unassigned annotations | annotation    | attributes   |
| monitor                | label         | origin       |
| externalURL   (*)      | internal      | externalUrl  |
| generatorlURL (*)      | internal      | moreInfo     |
| "prometheusAlert"      | n/a           | type         |
| raw notification       | n/a           | rawData      |

Prometheus labels marked with a star (*) are built-in and assignment to Alerta attributes happens automatically. All other labels or annotations are user-defined and completely optional as they have sensible defaults.

Be aware that during setup the complex alarms with sum and rate function `instance` and `exported_instance` labels can be missed from an alarm. These will need to be setup manually with:
```
ALERT ...rate_too_low 
  IF sum by (host) (rate(....)) < 10
  FOR 2m
  LABELS {
    value = "{{$value}}",
    environment = "Production",
    instance = "{{$labels.host}}"
  }
```

Many more values can be obtained from the Alerta console if reasonable values are assigned where possible. This is demonstrated in the example alert rules below. This example shows an increasingly more informative alarm.

Run the example
---------------

Use the provided `prometheus.yml`, `rules.conf` and `alertmanager.yml`
files to start with and run `prometheus` and `alertmanager` as follows:

    $ ./prometheus -config.file=prometheus.yml -alertmanager.url=http://localhost:9093
    $ ./alertmanager -config.file=alertmanager.yml

Or if you have Docker installed run:

    $ docker-compose up -d

Prometheus Web => http://localhost:9090

Alertmanager Web => http://localhost:9093

Examples
--------

*Basic Example*

The example rule below is the absolute minimum required to trigger a "warning" alert and a corresponding "normal" alert for forwarding to Alerta.

```
ALERT MinimalAlert
  IF metric > 0
  LABELS {}
```

*Simple Example*

```
ALERT SimpleAlert
  IF metric > 0
  LABELS {
    service = "Web",
    severity = "major",
    value = "{{$value}}"
  }
  ANNOTATIONS {
    description = "simple alert triggered at {{$value}}"
  }
```

*Complete Example*

```
global:
  external_labels:
    environment: Production
    service: Prometheus
    monitor: codelab
```

```
ALERT CompleteAlert
  IF metric > 0
  LABELS {
    service = "Web",
    severity = "minor",
    value = "{{$value}}",
  }
  ANNOTATIONS {
    summary = "alert triggered",
    description = "complete alert triggered at {{$value}}",
    runbook = "http://wiki.alerta.io"
  }
```

It is desirable that the `prometheus.yml` and `rules.conf` configuration files conform to an expected format
but this is not mandatory.

It is possible to set global labels which will be used for all alerts that are sent to Alerta. For instance, you can label your server with 'Production' or 'Development'. You can also describe the service, like 'Prometheus'.

Example `prometheus.yml` Global section:

```
global:
  external_labels:
    environment: Production
    service: Prometheus
    monitor: codelab
```

Metrics
-------

Alerta exposes prometheus metrics natively on `/management/metrics` so alerts can be generated based on Alerta performance.

[Counter, Gauge and Summary metrics](http://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/) are exposed and all use `alerta` as the application prefix. Metrics are created lazily, so for example, a summary metric for the number of deleted alerts will not be present in the metric output if an alert has never been deleted. 
Note that counters and summaries are **not** reset when Alerta restarts.
